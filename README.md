# Mafia 

Inspired by Among Us we decided to build our own [Mafia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game))-like game.
We are planning to create a simple turn-based game at first and see how it goes.

This project is mostly educational, but we hope that one day this game will be cool enough to actually play it xD.

## Progress so far

For now, we have lobbies, users with sessions and ability to join a lobby using a lobby code.

Also, we have a simplified state machine describing Mafia game and a simple test,
which feeds some sample data to this state machine.

## We are looking for

Programmers, Designers, Game Designers, Artists, Musicians, Writers, 
and just about everybody who can contribute to a project like this.

## Run project

1. npm install
2. npm run dev
